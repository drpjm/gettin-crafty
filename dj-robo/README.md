# DJ Robo
This folder contains the code and design files for my *DJ Robo* Halloween costume.
The basic idea was inspired by [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uJ8BhqKOaQ), but I will tweak it by adding my own beats via the [Adafruit NeoTrellis M4](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3938).

## Project Parts

+ NeoTrellis M4
+ USB cable
+ Power source (tbd)
+ USB breakout (for power)
+ Audio amplifier ([option one](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1712))
+ Stereo speakers ([maybe these](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1669))
